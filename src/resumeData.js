    "aboutme":"Engineering has undergone progressive innovation and improvement which has opened up vast fields with potential dimensions, the dimensions where civil engineering has conferred an aggregated portion. Civil Engineering is the most ancient mode of engineering which has been developing, proliferating and advancing from the beginning of human existence. As a professional in the subject of civil engineering, which benefits both individuals and society as a whole, I look forward to playing a vital role in this profession. I have always been deeply enthralled by the complexity and gigantic field of civil engineering. My formal education in civil engineering commenced when I enrolled at Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology (RUET), Bangladesh, for undergraduate studies. Since RUET is recognized as one of the best academic institutions for engineering, I believe this was the greatest location for me to enhance, cultivate and evolve my technical knowledge. Immediately after the completion of my graduation in 2016, I started my career as an assistant engineer in a construction project where I was able to gain the experience of practical implementation of civil engineering. After one year of field work, I started working as a professional civil engineer and I have contributed in more than 20 nos. International & Local projects. Within five years I was appointed as the head of the department in 2021 and started leading a team of young civil engineers & surveyors. I want to acquire more knowledges and skills in the field of Civil Engineering and want to contribute to the growing economic development of my country as well as the world.",
